# Manifest Reference (`knitpkg.yaml`)

This page documents the fields accepted by KnitPkg in the project manifest file: `knitpkg.yaml`.

!!! note "Manifest file names"
    The most common manifest file name is `knitpkg.yaml`, but `knitpkg.yml` is also accepted.

    JSON is supported as well. In that case, the manifest must be named `knitpkg.json`.

!!! note
    The manifest is intentionally forward-compatible. Unknown fields are allowed, so the format can evolve over time (and you can keep custom metadata in your manifest).

### `compile` (optional)

- **Type:** list of strings (paths)
- **Meaning:** Source files KnitPkg should compile (e.g. `.mq4` / `.mq5`) when running compilation-related commands.
- **Typical usage:** Put your EA/Indicator “entry” `.mq5`/`.mq4` files here (not `.mqh` headers).

---

## Dependencies

### `dependencies` (optional)

- **Type:** map/dictionary of `dependency -> version_range` or `dependency -> local_path`
- **Meaning:** Declares the direct dependencies required by this project.

    **Dependency key format**

    - If the dependency is in the **same organization** declared by this manifest (`organization`), you can omit the organization prefix:

        ```yaml
        organization: douglasrechia
        dependencies:
            calc: ^1.0.0
        ```

    - If the dependency belongs to a **different organization**, prefix it with `@organization/`:

        ```yaml
        dependencies:
            '@douglasrechia/calc': ^1.0.0
            '@acme/utils': ~2.1.0
        ```

    **Version range format**

    - Values are SemVer ranges (npm-style operators such as `^`, `~`, `<`, `>`, `*`, `!=`, etc.), as supported by KnitPkg. See: [Version ranges](version-ranges.md).

    **Local path**

    - Local paths are accepted in the place of the version range. In this case, KnitPkg resolves to a local project
        instead of fetching from the registry. This is useful for development and testing. Once the dependency
        is published to the registry, replace the local path with the correct version specifier.

        ```yaml
        dependencies:
            '@acme/utils': ../acme_utils
        ```

---

### `overrides` (optional)

- **Type:** map/dictionary of `dependency -> exactVersion`
- **Meaning:** Forces specific versions for dependencies (including transitive ones), similar to npm `overrides`.
- **Important:** Only **exact versions** are accepted here (no ranges). This is meant for “pin this dependency to exactly X.Y.Z”.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    overrides:
        '@someorg/somedep': "2.3.4"
    ```

---

## MQL-specific fields

These fields apply to MQL4/MQL5 repositories.

### `include_mode` (required)

- **Type:** string (enum)
- **Meaning:** Controls how KnitPkg makes dependency headers available to your project after installation.

Common modes:

- **`include`**: dependencies are made available as individual headers under a KnitPkg-managed include directory.
- **`flat`**: KnitPkg generates a flattened header (a single self-contained `.mqh`) per entrypoint under a KnitPkg-managed `flat/` directory.

---

### `entrypoints` (optional, but required for `include_mode: flat`)

- **Type:** list of strings (paths)
- **Meaning:** Header files that act as “roots” for the flattening process.
- **Typical usage:** Your project’s main `.mqh` that includes (directly or indirectly) all required package headers.

Example:

```yaml
include_mode: flat
entrypoints:
  - src/KnitPkgSMA.mqh
```

---

### `defines` (optional)

- **Type:** object with two optional subsections: `from_manifest` and `extra`
- **Meaning:** Declares compile-time constants that will be exported to `knitpkg/build/BuildInfo.mqh` as `#define` directives.
- **When to use:** To keep EA metadata (version, author, description) in sync with the manifest, or to define feature flags and build-time constants.

**Subsections:**

#### `from_manifest`

- **Type:** map of `CONSTANT_NAME -> manifest_field`
- **Meaning:** Maps constant names to manifest fields. The value of the manifest field will be exported as a `#define`.
- **Allowed manifest fields:** `version`, `organization`, `name`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `type`, `target`

Example:

```yaml
defines:
  from_manifest:
    MANIFEST_VERSION: version
    MANIFEST_ORG: organization
    MANIFEST_AUTHOR: author
    MANIFEST_DESCRIPTION: description
```

This generates:

```mql5
#define MANIFEST_VERSION "1.0.0"
#define MANIFEST_ORG "douglasrechia"
#define MANIFEST_AUTHOR "Douglas Rechia"
#define MANIFEST_DESCRIPTION "My project description"
```

#### `extra`

- **Type:** map of `CONSTANT_NAME -> value`
- **Meaning:** Defines additional constants with explicit values.
- **Allowed values:** strings, numbers, booleans, or `null` (for flag-only defines)

Example:

```yaml
defines:
  extra:
    MQL_STORE_VERSION: '2.1'
    MAX_BARS: 500
    DEBUG_MODE: true
    FEATURE_X_ENABLED: null
```

This generates:

```mql5
#define MQL_STORE_VERSION "2.1"
#define MAX_BARS 500
#define DEBUG_MODE true
#define FEATURE_X_ENABLED
```

**Constraints:**

- Constant names must be valid C/MQL identifiers (letters, digits, underscores; cannot start with a digit)
- At least one of `from_manifest` or `extra` must be present if `defines` section exists
- Values in `extra` must be strings, numbers, booleans, or `null`

**Priority:** If the same constant name appears in multiple places, the resolution order is:

1. CLI `--define` / `-D` flags (highest priority)
2. `extra`
3. `from_manifest` (lowest priority)

See [Build Info](../user-guide/build-info.md) for detailed usage examples.

## Summary: required fields

In practice, a valid manifest must include at least:

- `target`
- `organization`
- `name`
- `description`
- `version`
- `type`

And for MQL projects:

- `include_mode`
- `entrypoints` (when using `include_mode: flat`)
